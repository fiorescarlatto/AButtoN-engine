# AButtoN Engine

AButtoN Engine is a lightweight 2D game engine built in Java for Android, developed using Android Studio in 2016 as my first-year university project. This engine provides core functionality for rendering, managing game objects, and handling properties, without any built-in editor or interface for game development.

## Features

- **Rendering System**: Efficient 2D rendering using Android's Canvas API.
- **Game Object Management**: Handles objects, their properties, and interactions.
- **Basic Game Loop**: Implements a simple but effective update-render loop.
- **Touch Input Handling**: Supports basic touch interactions for game development.
- **Lightweight & Modular**: Focused solely on the core engine, allowing for external game logic and UI development.

## Requirements

- **Language**: Java
- **Platform**: Android
- **IDE**: Android Studio (2016 version recommended)
- **Minimum Android Version**: API 16 (Jelly Bean) or higher

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fiorescarlatto/AButtoN-engine.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the engine in an Android environment.
4. Extend the engine by implementing your own game logic and assets.

## Limitations

- No built-in level editor or GUI for game creation.
- Limited to 2D game development.
- Lacks advanced physics and animation systems.

## Future Improvements

- Expand rendering capabilities (shaders, spritesheets, etc.).
- Implement a basic physics engine.
- Improve asset management and optimization.
